Description: R's sf package ships with self-contained GDAL
    executables, including a bare bones interface to several of the
    GDAL-related utility programs collectively known as the GDAL
    utilities. For each of those utilities, this package provides an R
    wrapper whose formal arguments closely mirror those of the GDAL
    command line interface. All of the utilities operate on data
    stored in files and typically write their output to other
    files. As a result, processing data stored in any of R's more
    common spatial formats (i.e. those supported by the sp, sf, and
    raster packages) will require first writing to disk, then
    processing with the package's wrapper functions before reading
    back into R.
